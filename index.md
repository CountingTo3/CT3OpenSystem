Welcome to Open System! The goal of me creating this website is to provide materials for learning STEM concepts entirely for free (hence, open sySTEM). 
This site is currently a massive work in progress as I am currently a college student, so please do not expect it to be comprehensive.

Also, as a disclaimer, as with all resources, there may be errors. I will try my best to fact check, but some do slip through the cracks. 
If some do slip through, please raise issues in the GitHub repository.
